## **[MIT iQuHACK 2022](https://www.iquise.mit.edu/iQuHACK/2022-01-28) | QuTech Quantum Key Distribution Challenge**

**Description:**
For this challenge you will be tasked with creating an interface and method to use quantum key distribution to send an encrypted message between the members of your team.	

**Background:**
As you might know, one of the major potential threats of a quantum computer is the ability to run an algorithm called Shor’s algorithm, which can efficiently do prime factorization. Because almost all contemporary encryption schemes rely on prime factorization, this could lead to large data security issues. Beyond just breaking current encryption, quantum computers also enable new methods of encryption that do not rely on prime factorization. One of these methods, Quantum Key distribution, lies at the heart of this challenge.		

**Challenge goal:**
The goal is to create an interface and method that allows two users to create a shared key through the use of a quantum computer. These quantum computers are accessible online through the quantum inspire framework, which can be programmed through using the languages cQASM or OpenQASM (e.g. with Qiskit). 

## **Project Outline**

**Team Members:** [Mannendri Olivares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mannendri), [Michael Tesfaye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-tesfaye-645387205/), [Brios Olivares](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brios-olivares/), [Juan Alvarez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-alvarez-2263b5212/)

**Problem Definition:** 

Whistleblowing is the practice of an employee “blowing the whistle” to reveal illicit company or government practices. Companies and government can often intercept this communication by using algorithms (e.g. Shor's algorithm) to compromise standard encryption schemes and eavesdrop. This can lead to workplace or government retaliation which ultimately harms the whistleblower.

**Solution:** 

enQrypt allows whistleblowers to report illicit practices with total privacy and no fear of retaliation.

**Goal:** 

To create a Flask-based web application that allows two users to communicate with each other by sending text messages which are encrypted using Quantum Key Distribution (with the BB84 protocol) implemented on a Quantum Inspire quantum computer.
